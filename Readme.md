You can easily generate your own Twitch OAuth tokens with this tool. Here is a quick usage guide for you:

## 1. Create your Twitch App

- Go to [Twitch Dev Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and login to your account.
- In your dashboard, click on "Register Your Application" button.
- Give your application a name, select your category and choose your client type.
- Under OAuth Redirect URLs, add `https://twitchtokentool.click` .
- Complete the reCAPTCHA test and create your application.

Now that you have created your app, you can see your Client ID and by clicking on "New Secret" button, a Client Secret token will be generated for you. Make sure to store them somewhere safe.

## 2. Generate your tokens

- Open [Twitch Token Tool](https://twitchtokentool.click#generate) and go to "Generate Token" section.
- Provide your Client ID and Client Secret and hit "Generate" .
- You will be redirected to Twitch Authorization page. Click "Authorize" .

Your tokens are now easily generated! There are two tokens and here is a description about each of them:

- **Access Token:** This is your main token to use in your app.
- **Refresh Token:** Access token expires after a short time so you need to refresh it using your refresh token. For more information visit [Refresh Token](https://github.com/bllackbull/twitchtokentool?tab=readme-ov-file#3-refresh-token) section.

Make sure to store both tokens somewhere safe.

> **Note:** By default, the generated access token doesn't include any scopes. You can select the scopes you want to be included in your token by clicking on "Configure Scopes" button before generating your token. For more information about scopes, visit [Twitch API scopes](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/scopes/#twitch-access-token-scopes) documentation.

## 3. Refresh Token

  - API will respond to you with a JSON formatted data which includes `access_token` which is your new access token.

> **Note:** You can only use this tool for tokens that were previously generated by Twitch Token Tool.
